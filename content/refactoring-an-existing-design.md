# Creating Styles for an Existing Design

We don't always get to start from a greenfield, sometimes might already have [an existing design that we want to refactor into styles in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l4xtEss5K7SVuK5LuKMCi1/Frontend-Masters-Courses?node-id=0%3A1).

We can create styles for the following:

- Buttons / Primary
- Buttons / Secondary
- Course / Header
- Tabs / Selected
- Secondary / Dark (the next workshop modal)
- Secondary / Medium (the next workshop modal background)
- Primary / Dark (the top navigation)

## Alternative Approaches

- If we're trying to reverse engineer a color palette from a design that was just using arbitrary values, we can use the [UI Color Palette](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1063959496693642315) plugin to generate an entire color palette on our behalf.
- If we only have some images for brand assets we can use [Matt DesLaurier's, a Frontend Masters instructor](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/matt-deslauriers/), [Image Palette Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731841207668879837/Image-Palette).
