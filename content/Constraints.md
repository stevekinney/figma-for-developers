# Constraints

Constraints are important, right? My therapist says that it's good to have boundaries.

Jokes asideâ€”you know what's not fun? Here is an incomplete list of not fun things:

* Manually adjusting the positioning over like everything whenever you adjust anything.
* Manually moving stuff around by hand for all of the different screen sizes and devices you may or may not be designing for.

Here is a really good description of what Constraints are that I stole from [Figma's documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957734-Apply-constraints-to-define-how-layers-resize):

 > 
 > Constraints tell Figma how layers should respond when you resize their frames. This helps you to control how designs look across different screen sizes and devices.

By default, constraints are set to the top and the left.

The cool thing that constraints let you do is set the position relative to the frame that contains it.

* You can have it move along with the right edge as you widen the frame.
* You can have it stretch relative to left and right edges of the frame.
* You can have it stay in the center as your resize the frame.
* You can have it scale along with the size of the frame.
