## What is this course?

1. This is a course on creating prototypes and user interface designs in Figma.
1. It's a course designed to make your life easier when you're on the receiving end of a Figma design.
1. It's a course to help you help the designers you work with create Figma designs that make the above easier for everyone involved.

### What isn't this course?

This not a course on design itself. Don't worry, our buds at Frontend Masters have you covered on that front:

- [Design for Developers with Sarah Drasner](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers/)
- [\# Web UX Design for High Converting Websites](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/ux-design-principles/)

## Who is this for?

- Developers who work closely with designers using Figma at their company..
- Developers who might not have a full-time designer at their company.
- Developers who might want to learn how to use design tools in their side projects.
- Designers who want to learn how to organize their Figma projects to make the lives of the developers on their team significantly easier.

## What are we going to cover?

There are three major themes across the content that we're covering today.

1. We're going to cover how to use Figma to create designs.
   - Along the way we're going to lean hard on concepts from software engineering.
1. We're going to pay special attention to how you can work with a Figma to help you as you implement designs and mock-ups in code.
1. We're going to cover how use Figma to lay the foundation for your design system.

## Who am I?

Hi! My name is [Steve Kinney](https://stevekinney) and I'm the front-end architect and head of product engineering at [Temporal](https://temporal.io). where I work closely with the head of design to research, prototype, and build the next-generation of Temporal's user interface, cloud administration and developer tools.

Previously, I was the front-end architect at [Twilio](https://twilio.com) and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid), whereâ€”amongst other things not particularly relevant for _this_ course, I worked closely with product design and [Paste](https://paste.twilio.design). Twilio's best-in-class design system.

TL;DR: I've been on the engineering side of many a Figma design in my day and have been knee-deep in design systems for longer than I care to admit.

## What do I need?

You will _definitely_ need the following:

- A [Figma](https://figma.com) account

You might choose to use:

- The [Figma desktop application](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)
- One of the [Figma mobile applications](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)

The desktop application is mostly just a wrapper around the web application and doesn't offer much beyond the web application. So, it's not required, but if you like have your tools as stand alone applications from your browser, it can be useful. I am going to use it for this course mostly because it's easier to switch between my browser and the application, but there is nothing that I'm going to be doing that _requires_ the desktop application.
